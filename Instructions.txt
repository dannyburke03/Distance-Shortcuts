These three scripts were made to make speedrunning in Distance more efficient.
Simply run the script via AutoHotKey, and change you'll be able to perform the following tasks with ease*:

Shift+V ~ Restarts the level 
Shift+X ~ Return to Main Menu
Shift+Z ~ Go to Next Level

Keep in mind, this is a work-in-progress project. Some shortcuts may be changed, and more shortcuts will likely be added in the near future.

Feel free to edit the scripts to your liking (e.g. change the shortcut you want to use).




*You no longer have to scroll and confirm that you want to perform the task at hand anymore!
